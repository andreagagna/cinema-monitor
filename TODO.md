1. Implement a `ScreeningDiscovery` component that fetches a movie page, locates `<div class="qb-movie-info-column">`, and emits structured screening descriptors (time, metadata, order URL), then filters them according to `Config` criteria (e.g., after 18:00 on weekdays). **(DONE – new `ScreeningDiscovery` + `ScreeningDescriptor`, filter logic tied to `AppConfig`, and pytest coverage with fixtures)**
2. Implement a `SeatMapFetcher` that downloads booking pages, extracts `<svg id="svg-seatmap">`, and exposes the SVG markup with solid error handling/retries. **(DONE – `SeatMapFetcher` + tests verify SVG extraction & error handling)**
3. Design the seat domain model (`Seat`, `SeatRow`, `SeatMap`) and build a parser that converts the SVG DOM into these structures (parsing `aria-description`, `s` attributes, `<text>` labels). **(DONE – `src/seat_map.py` provides domain types plus parser, with fixture-based tests)**
4. Build the seat selection engine capable of filtering by availability/wheelchair seats, scoring positions, and finding contiguous blocks of N seats. **(DONE – `SeatSelector` + scoring/contiguous block logic with tests)** 
5. Expose a public API that wires date sweeping → discovery → fetch → parse → selection, returning JSON-friendly data for downstream consumers. **(DONE – `SeatAdvisor` orchestrator + tests)** 
6. Implement date-iteration utilities that advance the `at` parameter day-by-day (until a configurable horizon) and detect redirects when a day has no shows. **(DONE – `DateSweepConfig` + `iter_available_dates` scaffolding introduced; redirect detection to be layered atop when wiring real responses)**
7. Create test fixtures (HTML + SVG samples) and add comprehensive pytest coverage for discovery, parsing, and seat-selection logic. **(DONE – fixtures + tests already in place)**
8. Revisit the scheduler/monitor loop to call the new library, incorporate retry/backoff, and manage CAPTCHA detection. **(DONE – `MonitorScheduler` now orchestrates advisor + notifier with retry/backoff; main entrypoint uses it)** 
9. Enhance alerting robustness (config validation, clearer failure modes, optional fallback channels). **(DONE – Notifier now validates config, logs explicit reasons, and supports fallback handlers/test coverage)** 
10. Add CI plus linting/formatting (ruff/black/mypy) so regressions and style issues get caught automatically. **(DONE – pyproject adds tool configs, and `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs ruff/black/mypy/pytest)** 
11. Provide a status report after completing the above tasks, summarizing changes, reliability, remaining risks, and follow-up recommendations.
